## Edgar O. Castro Mendez

I am a postdoc fellow and Adjuct Professor at Tecnologico de Monterrey.

I am an applied micro-economist specializing in public economics and market interventions. I employ laboratory and field experiments, alongside observational data, to provide insights and draw policy implications for real-world problems.

I received my Ph.D in Economics from the Interdisciplinary Center for Economic Science at George Mason University in December 2023.
