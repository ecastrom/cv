## Research

My research studies how incentives, information, and beliefs shape individual behavior and public policy outcomes. I focus on settings where prices, rules, or information are distorted, and where behavioral responses play a central role in the effectiveness of policy design. Methodologically, my work combines experimental and causal inference methods, including field and natural experiments, and the analysis of administrative data.
